There will be 6 people, and we will be arriving on Saturday. <br> **system:** [missing sentence] <br> **user:** Yes, what about 2 nights instead of 4? <br> **system:** [missing sentence] <br> **user:** No, that looks like everything. Thanks. Bye. <br> **system:** [missing sentence] <br> ========== <br> **1.** <br> - The user asks the system to look up a hotel in the centre; the system should respond to this query. <br> - \"Not in terms of that\" seems to be responding to the system's suggestion which the user does not care about (e.g., price range, free wifi that are not required by the user anywhere in the dialogue). The user asks if \"they\" have free parking and a 3-star rating, which means the system should provide some hotel suggestions, but NOT parking and star information! <br> - Later in the chat, the user mentioned Gonville Hotel, which the system has likely suggested to them. If suggesting particular hotels, it is likely one of them. <br> - There are three hotels in the center of town. Do you prefer something moderate or expensive? <br> **2.** <br> - The user asked if the suggested hotels have free parking and are 3-star, which the system must respond to. <br> - The user replies \"okay\" to the system's suggestion and provided details of their booking at Gonville Hotel. The system has likely suggested Gonville Hotel and asked if the user wishes to make a booking. <br> - NA <br> - The Gonville Hotel has 3 stars and parking, and the University Arms Hotel has 4 stars and parking. They are both expensive. Would you like more details? <br> **3.** <br> - Booking details at a particular hotel have been provided by the user; the system can attempt to make a booking. <br> - The user says 'yes' to the system and then shortens the stay to 2 nights. This means the system was potentially unable to make a booking as initially required and suggested shortening the days. <br> - Book day, book stay, and book people must be provided to make a booking. In case of a failed booking, the system can suggest changing the length or time of stay, suggest another hotel that satisfies all requirements, or ask the user to relax a previously stated requirement (in this case, 3-star, free parking, area). <br> - I'm sorry, there are no rooms available for that length of stay. Could you shorten your stay or book a different day possibly? <br> **4.** <br> - The user agreed to shorten the stay. <br> - The user says 'no' to the system and claims that they are all set and ended the conversation. The system has likely successfully made a booking and asked if the user needs anything else. <br> - NA <br> - Sure, that worked. You have booked 2 nights, and your reference number is RU89U6V8. Can I be of further help today? <br> **5.** <br> - The user expressed appreciation and ended the conversation. <br> - No more user sentences. <br> - The user has ended the conversation. The system should end the conversation. <br> - You're welcome. Enjoy your stay! <br> **Completed Dialogue:** <br> **user:** I'm looking for a hotel to stay at in the centre, can you look this up for me? <br> **system:** There are three hotels in the center of town.

    "| **Example Dialogue** | Here is a demonstration partial dialogue unrelated to your own goal: <br> **user:** Hello, I'm looking for a guesthouse on the westside to stay. <br> **system:** I am sorry I have no guest houses in the west. Can I look one up in another area for you? <br> **user:** Are there any other places like that that also have free parking and free wifi in that area? <br> **system:** I have found one that is cheap with 4 stars, and one that is moderately priced with 3 stars? Do either of those sound appealing to you? <br> **user:** The cheap one with the better rating sounds appealing. <br> **system:** Great! That's Finches Bed and Breakfast. It's located at 144 Thornton Road cb30nd. Would you like to book a stay? <br> **user:** Please book it for Friday, thank you. <br> **system:** Can you please tell me how many people will be staying and for how many nights? <br> **user:** Yes, 3 people for 5 nights starting on Monday. <br> **system:** Booking was unsuccessful. Want to try another hotel? <br> **user:** Yes, in the same price range please. <br> **system:** Worth House in the North is 4 stars and cheap. Would you like to try it? <br> **user:** The amount of stars does not matter as long as it is in the same price range. Does Worth House in the North include free parking and internet? <br> **system:** Okay well I was able to book you at The Worth House and your reference number is 86XVFEUY. <br> **user:** Thanks, that's all I need. Have a nice day. <br> **system:** You are welcome. Also for your reference, the Worth House does have free parking and wifi. May I help you with anything else? <br> **user:** No thanks. Thanks again for your help. <br> **system:** Enjoy your stay! <br> Do not copy anything from the demonstration! |\n",
    "| **Role-Specific Instructions (User)** | Here is your goal: <br> The user is looking for a place to stay. The hotel should be in the cheap price range and should be in the type of hotel. The hotel should include free parking and should include free wifi. Once the user finds the hotel, the user wants to book it for 6 people and 3 nights starting from Tuesday. If the booking fails, how about 2 nights? Make sure the user gets the reference number. <br> Note that you should not make a booking unless the goal explicitly mentions a booking. Do not ask for or provide information not specified in the goal. If you are looking for a specific hotel that cannot be found, and the goal does not specify an alternative action, end the conversation. |"
